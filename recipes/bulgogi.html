<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>About Bulgogi</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Bulgogi is a popular Korean dish known for its flavorful and savory grilled or stir-fried marinated beef. The name "Bulgogi" translates to "fire meat" in Korean. The dish typically involves thinly sliced beef that is marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, and pepper. Other ingredients such as sliced onions, mushrooms, and green onions may also be included in the marinade. After marinating, the beef is cooked on a grill or in a pan, resulting in a deliciously caramelized and tender dish. Bulgogi is often served with a side of rice and accompanied by various banchan (side dishes) such as kimchi. It is a popular choice for Korean barbecue and is enjoyed both at home and in Korean restaurants around the world. The dish's sweet and savory flavors, combined with the tender texture of the beef, make it a favorite among many food enthusiasts. </p>
