    <p style="text-align: center;">Tteokbokki, also spelled ddeokbokki or topokki, is a popular Korean street food and comfort dish. It consists of chewy rice cakes called "tteok," which are stir-fried or boiled in a spicy and sweet gochujang (Korean red chili paste) sauce. Tteokbokki is often accompanied by additional ingredients such as fish cakes, boiled eggs, and scallions, enhancing the dish's flavor and texture. The sauce used in tteokbokki typically incorporates a combination of gochujang, soy sauce, sugar, and other seasonings. The resulting flavor is a balance of spicy, sweet, and savory, making tteokbokki a favorite snack or meal among Koreans and enthusiasts of Korean cuisine. Tteokbokki is widely available in South Korea, both from street vendors and in restaurants. Its popularity has led to various adaptations and modern twists, such as cheese tteokbokki, seafood tteokbokki, and more. It has also gained international popularity, becoming a beloved dish beyond Korea's borders.</p>
