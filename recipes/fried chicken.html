    <p style="text-align: center;">Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) is a popular and distinctive style of fried chicken that has gained international acclaim. Known for its crispy exterior and flavorful coating, Korean fried chicken is often characterized by a thinner and lighter batter compared to traditional fried chicken. The chicken is typically double-fried to achieve a crunchy texture while keeping the meat juicy and tender. Korean fried chicken is commonly coated in a variety of sauces, offering a range of flavors to suit different preferences. Some popular sauce options include sweet and spicy gochujang (Korean red chili paste) glaze, soy garlic, honey butter, and more. These sauces contribute to the unique and delicious taste that sets Korean fried chicken apart. The dish has become a significant part of South Korean food culture, with many specialized fried chicken restaurants, known as "chimaek" establishments, where patrons enjoy pairing fried chicken with beer (maekju in Korean). The combination of crispy fried chicken and beer has become a social and culinary phenomenon in Korea and has gained popularity globally.</p>
